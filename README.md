### Chat-gpt
Chat-gpt is a web-based [chat service from OpenAI](https://chat.openai.com/) where you can ask anything. There is also a mobile Chat-GPT app.
Version 3.5 is free, but you have to create an account. Version 4 requires a paid subscription. Note that Chat-gpt doesn't have any data after november 2021.

## Google Bard
Google Bard is based on PaLM(instead of OpenAI which all of the AI options above are based on), Google's own large language model. Google Bard is only available in the UK and the US. To try it, you will need to use a VPN. 

## Hugging Face
[Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) is a community effort to build up an AI platform and tools. They have a lot of models and datasets.

## Generating images
Image generation has been around for a while with OpenAI's Dall-E being the first really hyped AI application. Google recently added image creation to Bard in collaboration with Adobe.

### DALL-E
Solidify's OpenAI instance has a DALL-E playground for experimenting with image generation using prompts.


### Microsoft Designer
[Microsoft Designer](https://designer.microsoft.com/) has prompt based image generation as part of its design a marketing campaign portfolio. It allows you to import your own picture and use that in the campaign designs instead. 

### Chat-GPT
Chat-gpt doesn't generate pure images directly, but can generate mermaid code to represent flow diagrams and such. A slightly limited range of mermaid code can be inserted directly into markdown files; it may need some tweaking. You can also put the mermaid code in [mermaid live](https://mermaid.live/edit) and then screen shot the preview for other use cases.
